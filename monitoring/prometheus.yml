    # If your Symfony 'php' service or workers expose custom metrics:
    # You would need to add a bundle/library to expose metrics from your Symfony app
    # e.g., 'symfony/prometheus-bundle' if it exists or roll your own endpoint.
    # For a basic Symfony app, you might only monitor the web server (Caddy/php service)
    # and the workers' resource usage via cAdvisor/Node Exporter.
    # This example assumes your 'php' service exposes metrics on /metrics (unlikely for a default symfony setup)
    # If your Symfony app has a custom /metrics endpoint, adapt the target below.
    # For most cases, you'll rely on cAdvisor for container metrics and Node Exporter for host.
    # static_configs:
    #   - targets: ['php:80'] # Or whatever port your php service uses if it exposes metrics
    # metrics_path: '/metrics' # Example, unlikely to exist by default.

  - job_name: 'symfony_workers'
    # This will monitor the individual worker containers using cAdvisor metrics by container name
    # You would typically rely on cAdvisor for per-container metrics and PromQL to filter
    # or you'd instrument your individual workers if they were separate applications.
    # Since your workers are all 'php_worker_submission_low_priority', 'php_worker_submission_high_priority', etc.,
    # cAdvisor will give you metrics for these container names.
    # No direct scrape config for each worker is usually needed if cAdvisor is doing its job.
    # If you were to add application-level metrics to your Symfony workers,
    # each worker would need its own metrics endpoint and a scrape config here.
    # For now, rely on cAdvisor's container_cpu_usage_seconds_total, container_memory_usage_bytes, etc.
    # Filtering in Grafana will be key here.
